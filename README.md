The code interaction.py measures the number of hydrogen bonds between two seleted residues. Define the universe and state the path to topology (topology should be in prmtop, psf and tpr) and trajectory. The code also calculate the time auto-correlation function

The code "Contact Maps between A2(H2B) and A3(H4) Helices.ipynb" measure the distance between selected residues in a contact map. Matplotlib is used to show the contact map between selected residues.
